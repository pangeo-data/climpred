Comparisons

Forecast skill is always evaluated against a reference for verification. In ESM-based predictions, it is common to compare the ensemble mean forecast against the reference.

In hindcast ensembles :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_hindcast`, this ensemble mean forecast (``comparison='e2r'``) is expected to perform better than individual ensemble members (``comparison='m2r'``) as the chaotic component of forecasts is expected to be suppressed by this averaging, while the memory of the system sustains. [Boer2016]_
HindcastEnsemble skill is computed by default as the ensemble mean forecast against the reference (``comparison='e2r'``).

In perfect-model frameworks :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_perfect_model`, there are even more ways of comparisons. [Seferian2018]_ shows comparison of the ensemble members against the control run (``comparison='m2c'``) and ensemble members against all other ensemble members (``comparison='m2m'``). Furthermore, using the ensemble mean forecast can be also verified against one control member (``comparison='e2c'``) or all members (``comparison='m2e'``) as done in [Griffies1997]_.
Perfect-model framework comparison defaults to the ensemble mean forecast verified against each member in turns (``comparison='m2e'``).

These different comparisons demand for a normalization factor to arrive at a normalized skill of 1, when skill saturation is reached (ref: metrics).

While HindcastEnsemble skill is computed over all initializations ``init`` of the hindcast, the resulting skill is a mean forecast skill over all initializations.
PerfectModelEnsemble skill is computed over a supervector comprised of all initializations and members, which allows the computation of the ACC-based skill [Bushuk2018]_, but also returns a mean forecast skill over all initializations.
The supervector approach shown in [Bushuk2018]_ and just calculating a distance-based metric like ``rmse`` over the member dimension as in [Griffies1997]_ yield very similar results.


Compute over dimension
######################

The optional argument ``dim`` defines over which dimension a metric is computed. We can apply a metric over ``dim`` from [``'init'``, ``'member'``, ``['member', 'init']``] in :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_perfect_model` and [``'init'``, ``'member'``] in :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_hindcast`. The resulting skill is then reduced by this ``dim``. Therefore, applying a metric over dim='member' creates a skill for all initialisations individually. This can show the initial conditions dependence of skill. Likewise when computing skill over ``'init'``, we get skill for each member. This ``dim`` argument is different from the ``comparison`` argument which just specifies how ``forecast`` and ``reference`` are defined.
However, this above logic applies to deterministic metrics. Probabilistic metrics need to be applied to the ``member`` dimension and ``comparison`` from [``'m2c'``, ``'m2m'``] in :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_perfect_model` and ``'m2r'`` comparison in :py:func:`climpred.prediction.compute_hindcast`. Using a probabilistic metric automatically switches internally to using ``dim='member'``.
