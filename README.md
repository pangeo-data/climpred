## Release

Note that `climpred` is in the very early stages of development. We are currently working on documentation and are adding features when we have the time to do so. There is no timeline for a formal v1 release, but you can install the package below and reference the notebooks for guidance. Please raise any issues if you encounter any bugs or have any ideas; you can also raise a PR to add new features. Feel free to contact either of us if you have questions.

## Installation
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/bradyrx/climpred
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be found on this Github's [wiki](https://github.com/bradyrx/climpred/wiki). It is currently in development and will eventually move to a `sphinx` page.
