    "# PredictionEnsemble Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major features of `climpred` is our objects that are based upon the `PredictionEnsemble` class. We supply users with a `HindcastEnsemble` and `PerfectModelEnsemble` object. We encourage users to take advantage of these high-level objects, which wrap all of our core functions. These objects don't comprehensively cover all functions yet, but eventually we'll deprecate direct access to the function calls in favor of the lightweight objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, we consider a `HindcastEnsemble` to be one that is initialized from some observational-like product (e.g., assimilated data, reanalysis products, or a model reconstruction). Thus, this object is built around comparing the initialized ensemble to various observational products. In contrast, a `PerfectModelEnsemble` is one that is initialized off of a model control simulation. These forecasting systems are not meant to be compared directly to real-world observations. Instead, they provide a contained model environment with which to theoretically study the limits of predictability. You can read more about the terminology used in `climpred` [here](terminology.html).\n",
