## Perfect-Model Simulations

Sample datasets of perfect-model (PM) predictability runs with the MPI-ESM-LR esmControl.

Contact: Aaron Spring, aaron.spring@mpimet.mpg.de

All of the following output is saved for annual means, and DJF, JJA, MAM, and SON seasonal averages. Area means are provided for the globe and North Atlantic.

-   PM_MPI-ESM-LR_control.nc : surface temperature, surface salinity, and AMO for 300-year control run.

-   PM_MPI-ESM-LR_control3d.nc : surface temperature, surface salinity for 50 years including latitude and longitude.

-   PM_MPI-ESM-LR_ds.nc : surface temperature, surface salinity, and AMO with 10 ensemble members for 12 initialization years, integrated forward for 20 years each.

-   PM_MPI-ESM-LR_ds3d.nc : surface temperature, surface salinity with lat/lon for 4 initialization years, with 4 members each for 5 years of integration.

## Community Earth System Model Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE)

Sample datasets of decadal prediction runs that are initialized from a forced ocean sea-ice reconstruction simulation.

Contact: Riley Brady, riley.brady@colorado.edu

-   CESM-DP-LE.SST.annmean.anom.nc : Global-averaged SST with 40-member ensembles for 62 initialization years integrated for 10 years each.

-   CESM-LE.global_mean.SST.1955-2015.nc : Global-averaged SST for companion uninitialized run; ensemble mean.

-   ERSSTv4.global.mean.nc : Global-averaged ERSSTv4 observations over same time period as the decadal prediction ensemble.

-   g.e11_LENS.GECOIAF.T62_g16.009.pop.h.SST.024901-031612.nc : Global-averaged monthly SST for the reconstruction simulation that initializes the CESM-DPLE.
