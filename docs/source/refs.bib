  abstract = {A new parameter of dynamical system predictability is introduced that measures the potential utility of predictions. It is shown that this parameter satisfies a generalized second law of thermodynamics in that for Markov processes utility declines monotonically to zero at very long forecast times. Expressions for the new parameter in the case of Gaussian prediction ensembles are derived and a useful decomposition of utility into dispersion (roughly equivalent to ensemble spread) and signal components is introduced. Earlier measures of predictability have usually considered only the dispersion component of utility. A variety of simple dynamical systems with relevance to climate and weather prediction is introduced, and the behavior of their potential utility is analyzed in detail. For the climate systems examined here, the signal component is at least as important as the dispersion in determining the utility of a particular set of initial conditions. The simple ``weather'' system examined (the Lorenz system) exhibited different behavior with the dispersion being more important than the signal at short prediction lags. For longer lags there appeared no relation between utility and either signal or dispersion. On the other hand, there was a very strong relation at all lags between utility and the location of the initial conditions on the attractor.},

  abstract = {Several skill scores are defined, based on the mean-square-error measure of accuracy and alternative climatological standards of reference. Decompositions of these skill scores are formulated, each of which is shown to possess terms involving 1) the coefficient of correlation between the forecasts and observations, 2) a measure of the nonsystematic (i.e., conditional) bias in the forecast, and 3) a measure of the systematic (i.e., unconditional) bias in the forecasts. Depending on the choice of standard of reference, a particular decomposition may also contain terms relating to the degree of association between the reference forecasts and the observations. These decompositions yield analytical relationships between the respective skill scores and the correlation coefficient, document fundamental deficiencies in the correlation coefficient as a measure of performance, and provide additional insight into basic characteristics of forecasting performance. Samples of operational precipitation probability and minimum temperature forecasts are used to investigate the typical magnitudes of the terms in the decompositions. Some implications of the results for the practice of forecast verification are discussed.},

In that case, simpler yet more compelling full-sample model comparison procedures exist; they have been, and should continue to be, widely used. The hunch that pseudo-out-of-sample analysis is somehow the ``only,'' or ``best,'' or even necessarily a ``good'' way to provide insurance against in-sample overfitting in model comparisons proves largely false. On the other hand, pseudo-out-of-sample analysis remains useful for certain tasks, perhaps most notably for providing information about comparative predictive performance during particular historical episodes.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe importance of defining confidence intervals for sample statistics that are used to estimate characteristics of the parent population(s) is emphasised. Not all sample statistics are unbiased estimators or have normally distributed sampling distributions and so it is not always easy to reflect the reliability of the estimator. In such cases, Efron's ``bias corrected percentile method'', which uses bootstrap samples to estimate the bias and makes no assumptions about the distribution of the sample statistic can be used to define confidence limits for the population parameter. The method is explained and the procedure for calculating the confidence limits is outlined.As an example, bootstrap confidence limits calculated for the maximum correlation between the Southern Oscillation Index and rainfall at South African stations over the period 1935\textendash{}1983 suggest that the sample correlation is an unreliable measure of the true association. One possible reason for this is that the association is thought to have broken down during the 1940s. However, the reliability of the estimator does not seem to improve when confidence limits are calculated for the 30-year period 1954\textendash{}1983. It is possible that the width of the confidence interval is an indication of more than one distinct statistical population.},

  issn = {00948276},
  abstract = {The decadal predictability of carbon fluxes has been examined over continents and oceans using a ``perfect model'' approach based on a 400 year preindustrial simulation and five 10-member ensembles from the Centre National de Recherches M{\'e}t{\'e}orologiques-Earth System Model version 1. From these experiments, we find that the global land uptake and ocean carbon uptake are potentially predictable by up to six years, with a median predictability horizon of four years. Predictability of global carbon uptake is prominently driven by the ocean's predictability. The difference in predictability between ocean and land carbon fluxes stems from the relative capability of ocean or land to generate low-frequency fluctuations in carbon flux. Indeed, ocean carbon fluxes display low-frequency variability that emerges from the year-to-year variability in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean carbon uptake can be predicted up to six years in advance and explains most of the global carbon uptake predictability.},

  title = {A Predictability Study of Simulated {{North Atlantic}} Multidecadal Variability},
  volume = {13},
  issn = {0930-7575, 1432-0894},
  abstract = {. The North Atlantic is one of the few places on the globe where the atmosphere is linked to the deep ocean through air\textendash{}sea interaction. While the internal variability of the atmosphere by itself is only predictable over a period of one to two weeks, climate variations are potentially predictable for much longer periods of months or even years because of coupling with the ocean. This work presents details from the first study to quantify the predictability for simulated multidecadal climate variability over the North Atlantic. The model used for this purpose is the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model used extensively for studies of global warming and natural climate variability. This model contains fluctuations of the North Atlantic and high-latitude oceanic circulation with variability concentrated in the 40\textendash{}60 year range. Oceanic predictability is quantified through analysis of the time-dependent behavior of large-scale empirical orthogonal function (EOF) patterns for the meridional stream function, dynamic topography, 170 m temperature, surface temperature and surface salinity. The results indicate that predictability in the North Atlantic depends on three main physical mechanisms. The first involves the oceanic deep convection in the subpolar region which acts to integrate atmospheric fluctuations, thus providing for a red noise oceanic response as elaborated by Hasselmann. The second involves the large-scale dynamics of the thermohaline circulation, which can cause the oceanic variations to have an oscillatory character on the multidecadal time scale. The third involves nonlocal effects on the North Atlantic arising from periodic anomalous fresh water transport advecting southward from the polar regions in the East Greenland Current. When the multidecadal oscillatory variations of the thermohaline circulation are active, the first and second EOF patterns for the North Atlantic dynamic topography have predictability time scales on the order of 10\textendash{}20 y, whereas EOF-1 of SST has predictability time scales of 5\textendash{}7 y. When the thermohaline variability has weak multidecadal power, the Hasselmann mechanism is dominant and the predictability is reduced by at least a factor of two. When the third mechanism is in an extreme phase, the North Atlantic dynamic topography patterns realize a 10\textendash{}20 year predictability time scale. Additional analysis of SST in the Greenland Sea, in a region associated with the southward propagating fresh water anomalies, indicates the potential for decadal scale predictability for this high latitude region as well. The model calculations also allow insight into regional variations of predictability, which might be useful information for the design of a monitoring system for the North Atlantic. Predictability appears to break down most rapidly in regions of active convection in the high-latitude regions of the North Atlantic.},
