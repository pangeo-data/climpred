            ``time`` and containing ``lead`` dim.
        verif (``xarray`` object): Verification data with ``time`` dim.
        alignment (str): Strategy for initialization-verification alignment.
            * 'same_inits': Use a common set of initializations that verify
               across all leads. This ensures that there is no bias in the result due
               to the state of the system for the given initializations.

               ensures that there is no bias in the result due to the observational
