  We are actively looking for new contributors for climpred! Riley moved to McKinsey's
  Climate Analytics team. Aaron is finishing his PhD, but will stay in academia.
  We especially hope for python enthusiasts from seasonal, subseasonal or weather
  prediction community. In our past coding journey, collaborative coding, feedbacking
  issues and pull requests advanced our code and thinking about forecast verification
  more than we could have ever expected.
